# Higher Level Programming with Python

Higher-level programming refers to the practice of writing code in a programming language that is more abstracted from the machine code. This abstraction allows developers to write code that is more readable, maintainable, and often faster to develop.

## Features of Python:

- **Readability**: Python's syntax is designed to be clear and readable, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain code.

- **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the data type of a variable when you create it. This can lead to faster development but requires careful attention to variable types.

- **Rich Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and packages for various tasks, from file I/O to web development.

- **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing developers to create reusable and organized code structures.

## Getting Started:

1. **Installation**: To get started with Python, you'll need to [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.

2. **Hello World**: Once Python is installed, you can write your first program by creating a file named `hello.py` and adding the following code:
   
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
